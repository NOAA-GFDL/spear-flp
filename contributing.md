This project has limited scope and is a prototype effort to support a specific data dissemination effort. 
The climate projections task force members are kindly requested to checkout the document on: Collaborative Quality Assurance for Climate Projections Task Force, in particular the Data access policy. 
For questions, contact TF co-leads or open a GitHub issue.

#### Where can I find the URL to the data holdings? 

Please see Data availability section in the document titled: Collaborative Quality Assurance for Climate Projections Task Force ( Only shared with the climate projections TF)

#### How to make a QA report:

Go to "Issues", press the "New issue" button in the top right, and then choose "QC Update". Or, click [here](https://github.com/ariaradick/projections-tf-spear/issues/new?template=qc_update.yml) to open a new issue.
The form will ask a few questions. This helps us record the status of the QA, and initiate next steps. 

For time range, you can leave blank to select all time ranges for the given variable and experiment. Otherwise, you can pass multiple by putting commas between them, e.g.,
```
20410101-20501231, 20110101-20201231, 20510101-20601231, 20310101-20401231
```
Please make sure all 30 ensemble members pass before reporting.
