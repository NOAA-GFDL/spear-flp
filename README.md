# How to make a QA report:

Go to "Issues", press the "New issue" button in the top right, and then choose "QC Update". The form will ask a few questions.

For time range, you can leave blank to select all time ranges for the given variable and experiment. Otherwise, you can pass multiple by putting commas between them, e.g.,
```
20410101-20501231, 20110101-20201231, 20510101-20601231, 20310101-20401231
```

N.B.: It is not possible to pass QC for individual ensemble members at this time. Please make sure all 30 ensemble members pass before reporting.
