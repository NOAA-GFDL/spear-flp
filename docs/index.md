### SPEAR FLP Data stewardship

This site hosts **documentation and outreach materials** for the **SPEAR Forward Looking Project**.

SPEAR stands for [Seamless System for Prediction and EArth System Research](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/spear_large_ensembles/). SPEAR-FLP is an effort to develop prototype tools and services that supports transparent data access, shared data stewardship, and practical use of large-ensemble Earth system model outputs across scientific and stakeholder communities. The GFDL data science group manages this repository and documentation. Community contributions through GitHub issues, discussions and PRs are accepted. 

Data availability: Check out this <https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/spear_large_ensembles/>.
